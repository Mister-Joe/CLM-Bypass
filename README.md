# CLM-Bypass
Bypass PowerShell constrainted language mode (CLM) through runspaces.

## Usage
I'd recommend compiling with Visual Studio and at least .NET 3.5. Use a console application template. Edit the source to include the PS command you'd like executed. Execute the compiled executable using your preferred method.
